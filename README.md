## Overview

This repository defines Azure infrastructure using Terraform and handles deployment workflows via GitHub Actions (look for files in `.github/workflows/`). It sets up resources like App Services or other components as coded in Terraform.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed locally (≥ Terraform 0.13)
- An active **Azure Subscription**
- Authentication method (e.g., Azure CLI with `az login`, or a Service Principal with environment variables)
- (Optional) GitHub Actions secrets configured for Azure credentials

---

## Getting Started

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alfiya-git/Azure-devops-Project.git
cd Azure-devops-Project
````

### Configure the Terraform backend

Edit the `backend.hcl` files to point to your remote backend (e.g., Azure Storage account) or continue using the default local state.

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    # e.g., storage_account_name, container_name, key, etc.
  }
}
```

### Initialize and Apply Terraform

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

---

## CI/CD Setup

This project uses GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/`) to automatically run Terraform based on repo activity:

1. Review the workflow YAML to understand triggers and steps.
2. Ensure required secrets (like Azure credentials) are set in the repository’s **Settings → Secrets**.
3. On pushing changes, workflows will run automatically to provision or update Azure resources.

---

## Cleaning Up

To destroy the deployed infrastructure:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

If using a remote backend, you may also want to delete the state storage manually or via the Azure portal.

---

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-change`.
3. Make your changes and update documentation as needed.
4. Commit, push, and open a Pull Request.
